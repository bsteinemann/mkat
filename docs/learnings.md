# Learnings & Patterns

This is a living document. After every implementation task, add an entry.
Read this file FIRST before starting any new work -- it prevents repeating mistakes.

---

## How to Use This File

- Scan before starting work (look for patterns related to your task)
- Add an entry after every implementation session (Phase 6 of workflow)
- Keep entries brief and actionable
- Tag entries with relevant keywords for searchability
